# Cover-Letter-Extension

A very rudimentary chrome extension that will help you write a cover letter and inshallah land that job.

You will need a locally served Ollama model (I use the llama3.2 model) 
You will need load the extension on chrome
You will need to set the OLLAMA_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://




Future changes: Have an option for uploading a resume as part of the context.
